Kaisaier:
Compiling on 4.24.3


10/19/2019
Sascha Elble:
This is the final version (apart from maintenance and bug fixing) for the old version of the ocean project.

4.22/4.23 compatible (with compiling on 4.23)

4.23 special note: A user reported you may/will have to go to plugins and package the ocean project manually or "apex destruction" error will appear, you could also remove apex destruction and turn off "Apex cloth" in the sails of the ships.

Moving forward:
I am starting to re-vamp the project into a new direction called the "Environment" project since this project started heading in that direction. The project will be split up into separate plugins. For now I've started work in the dif-tow branch, this will eventually all be moved to a new GitHub organization. 



Also, for hiding the ocean in certain parts so your (below ocean level) beautiful city does not "flood" look at the masking example map. 


# OceanProject
